Ingredients: Per 4 servings

    1 lb linguine

For pesto

    1 oz basil
    One half oz pine nuts
    1 clove of garlic
    2 oz grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese
    1 and one half oz grated Pecorino cheese
    1 cup extra virgin olive oil
    salt and pepper to taste

Preparation:

Place into a mortar (or into a modern mixer) well-washed and dried basil leaves, 
finely chopped garlic and pine nuts; add the necessary oil bit by bit.

Once you have quite a creamy mixture, blend in cheese to bring everything together, 
and salt to taste. Cook the linguine until 'al dente' in abundant salted boiling 
water, drain well and pour into a tureen.

Dress with pesto sauce and, should it be too thick, slightly dilute it with a glass 
of pasta cooking liquid. Sprinkle with grated cheese and serve immediately.
